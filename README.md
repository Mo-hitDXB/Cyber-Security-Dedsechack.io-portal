Project Title:

CyberSec Portal â€“ A Full-Stack Cybersecurity Resource Platform

Overview:

CyberSec Portal is a full-stack web application designed to provide students, professionals, and enthusiasts with centralized access to cybersecurity knowledge, training, and updates. The platform offers curated course links (free, discounted, or student offers), security tips & tricks, live cybersecurity news, and downloadable resources (PDFs and guides).

Unlike a static website, the portal is dynamic and admin-managed. Administrators can add/edit courses, post security updates, and upload resource documents. End-users can explore cybersecurity content, view the latest news about cyberattacks, and learn best practices to stay safe online.

The project integrates an external API (NewsAPI) to fetch real-time cybersecurity headlines, ensuring the platform remains up to date with global threats. To improve interactivity and engagement, the frontend also features a 3D AI-style assistant bot that welcomes users and guides them through the website like a virtual instructor.

Objectives:

Create a centralized cybersecurity learning hub with free and discounted resources.

Provide real-time news updates on cyberattacks and digital threats via API integration.

Deliver security awareness tips in an easy-to-digest format.
